%% This function extracts the eeg data from the Biosemi binary file
%% and convert them into mat format. There are 20 fields, as decsribed in https://www.biosemi.com/faq/file_format.htm
%% The code to extract the data has been written in C++ and is saved in the file named Read_BDF_MEX.cpp. It has been compiled with "MinGW64 Compiler (C++)"
%% Despite the BDF format allows for saving different characteristics for each channel (e.g. different sampling frequencies, etc.)
%% This code has been written under the assumption that all the channels will have the same characteristics (e.g. same sampling frequency, same gain, same filtering, etc.)
%% See these links for a description of the BDF (https://www.biosemi.com/faq/file_format.htm)
%% and EDF (https://edfrw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specifications.html) format
