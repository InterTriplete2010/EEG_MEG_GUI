% IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES M-file for Import_Biosemi_Files.fig
%      IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES, by itself, creates a new IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES returns the handle to a new IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES('Property','Value',...) creates a new IMPORT_BIOSEMI_FILES or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Read_Biosemi_Files_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Import_Biosemi_Files_OpeningFcn via varargin.
