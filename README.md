# EEG_MEG_GUI
EEG/MEG GUI

This simple toolbox has been written to allow the user do some of the most basic and commonly used analysis of EEG and MEG data. The user can start the GUI by typing "EEG_MEG_GUI". Please, remember to create a global path before starting the GUI. 

The GUI is divided into 3 menus:

1) Import data: this is a set of GUIs used to convert files recorded from a variety of EEG systems and to convert them into a mat format that can be used for analysis. It also suppoprt the sqd format for the MEG data (KIT);

2) Signal Analysis: this is a set of GUIs containing some of the most basic and commonly used analysis of EEG and MEG data, such as averaging, wavelets, Fourier, etc.

3) Tools: this is a set of GUIs used for basic manipulation of the data, such as removal of triggers, removal of senros, etc.

Each GUI has its own "Help" tab explaining how to use it. 

I hope this GUI will be of some help to someone.
